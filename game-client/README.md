# Game Client

This directory contains a skeleton React application for the runtime of the Text Adventure Card Web Game.  Itâ€™s created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React.  Use this package to implement the user interface for playing missions authored with the Mission Editor.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3001` by default.

At the moment this client displays a simple placeholder.  Extend it to load mission data from the `assets/missions` directory or an API, present scenes to the player, manage card decks and stats, and handle combat or skill checks.
